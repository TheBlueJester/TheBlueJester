        The Body is set to be a grid of 3 columns using CSS Grid (Display: Grid) 
        Columns 1 and 3 dynamically change size to provide even padding on either side of the main content. 
        Column 2 is given a fixed pixel width to meet the specifications of the assignment. 
        When viewed on a device with the minimum required resolution the main content fits the screen exactly.
        When viewed on a larger resolution columns 1 and 2 created padding / blank space on either side of the main content 
        so that it remains aligned in the center of the users screen.
